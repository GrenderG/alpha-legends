# Alpha Legends

Attemp to create the first playable 0.5.3 emulator. This project started as a fork of [barncastle's Alpha-WoW](https://github.com/barncastle/Alpha-WoW).

## Requirements

* [Visual Studio 2017/2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/es/) or [MonoDevelop](https://www.monodevelop.com/).
* It's recommended using [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/) instead of [MySql](https://www.mysql.com/) for compatibility.

## Installation

### Server

* Extract the `.dbc` files from the client and put them in a folder called dbc, then move it to the same folder as your compiled executable (Usually _bin/Debug_). Alternatively someone is hosting a copy of the dbc files [here](https://www.mediafire.com/file/qo9f9jhd571d8vz/dbc.zip/file)
* Run the sql file under the Database folder, and then apply everything inside the Database/Updates folder.
* Rename the `app.config.dist` file inside the WorldServer folder to app.config and edit it to point at your database server.

### Client

* Copy the `config.wtf` file located inside the dist/ folder to your client's WTF folder.
* Execute the WoWClient.exe file with `-uptodate` argument. I also recommend executing it with `-windowed` argument and/or `-console` argument, for convenience. Under GNU/Linux, Wine works fine, and under Windows, Windows XP compatibility mode is recommended.
* The account information is stored in a file called `wow.ses`. To create an account, launch the server and write `createacc name password [gmlevel (0 or 1)]` in the terminal.

## Problems

* Logitech G Hub and Origin updater could use the same port as server, so it's recommended to close them if you have problems during server initialization with busy sockets.
